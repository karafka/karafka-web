### Upgrade Notes

This is a **major** release that brings many things to the table.

This version of the Karafka Web UI requires Karafka `>= 2.4.7`. You can either upgrade both or upgrade Karafka first and then the Web UI. Karafka `2.4.7` is also compatible with Web UI `0.9.1`; thus, you can upgrade one at a time.

#### Configuration

Visibility Filters have been reorganized into messages policies.

Please read the [Policies API](https://karafka.io/docs/Pro-Web-UI-Policies/) documentation and convert your visibility filters to policies.

Your existing message-related visibility filter policies should now be assigned to a new configuration:

```ruby
Karafka::Web.setup do |config|
  config.ui.policies.messages = MyCustomRequestsPolicy.new
end
```

#### Deployment

Because of the reporting schema update, it is recommended to:

0. Make sure you have upgraded to `0.9.1` before and that it was fully deployed.
1. Test the upgrade on a staging or dev environment.
3. The Web UI interface may throw 500 errors during the upgrade because of schema incompatibility (until Puma is deployed and all consumers redeployed). This will have no long-term effects and can be ignored.
4. `Karafka::Web::Errors::Processing::IncompatibleSchemaError` **is expected**. It is part of the Karafka Web UI zero-downtime deployment strategy. This error allows the Web UI materialization consumer to back off and wait for it to be replaced with a new one.
5. Perform a rolling deployment (or a regular one) and replace all consumer processes.
6. Update the Web UI Puma.
7. **No** CLI command execution is required.
8. Enjoy.

### Upgrade Notes

This is a **major** release that brings many things to the table.

#### Configuration

**No** configuration changes are needed.

#### Deployment

Because of the reporting schema update, it is recommended to:

0. Make sure you have upgraded to `0.7.10` before and that it was fully deployed.
1. Test the upgrade on a staging or dev environment.
2. Starting from `0.7.0` Karafka Web UI supports rolling deploys, so there is no need to "stop the world".

5. Perform a rolling deployment (or a regular one) and replace all consumer processes.
6. Update the Web UI Puma.
7. **No** CLI command execution is required. Starting from this release (`0.8.0`), the Karafka Web UI contains an automatic schema migrator that allows it to automatically adjust internal topic data formats.
8. Enjoy.

## 0.7.10 (2023-10-31)
- [Fix] Max LSO chart does not work as expected (#201)

## 0.7.9 (2023-10-25)

### Upgrade Notes

This is a **major** release that brings many things to the table.

#### Configuration

Karafka Web UI now relies on Roda session management. Please configure the `ui.sessions.secret` key with a secret value string of at least 64 characters:

```ruby
# Configure it BEFORE enabling
Karafka::Web.setup do |config|
  # REPLACE THIS with your own value. You can use `SecureRandom.hex(64)` to generate it
  # You may want to set it per ENV
  config.ui.sessions.secret = 'REPLACE ME! b94b2215cc66371f2c34b7d0c0df1a010f83ca45 REPLACE ME!'
end

Karafka::Web.enable!
```

#### Deployment

Because of the reporting schema update and new web-ui topics introduction, it is recommended to:

0. Make sure you have upgraded to `0.6.3` before and that it was deployed. To all the environments you want to migrate to `0.7.0`.
1. Upgrade the codebase based on the below details.
2. **Stop** the consumer materializing Web-UI. Unless you are running a Web-UI dedicated consumer as recommended [here](https://karafka.io/docs/Web-UI-Development-vs-Production/), you will have to stop all the consumers. This is **crucial** because of schema changes. `karafka-web` `0.7.0` introduces the detection of schema changes, so this step should not be needed in the future.
3. Run a migration command: `bundle exec karafka-web migrate` that will create missing states and missing topics. You **need** to run it for each of the environments where you use Karafka Web UI.
4. Deploy **all** the Karafka consumer processes (`karafka server`).
5. Deploy the Web update to your web server and check that everything is OK by visiting the status page.

Please note that if you decide to use the updated Web UI with not updated consumers, you may hit a 500 error, or offset-related data may not be displayed correctly.

#### Code and API changes

1. `bundle exec karafka-web install` is now a single-purpose command that should run **only** when installing the Web-UI for the first time.
2. For creating needed topics and states per environment and during upgrades, please use the newly introduced non-destructive `bundle exec karafka-web migrate`. It will assess changes required and will apply only those.
3. Is no longer`ui.decrypt` has been replaced with `ui.visibility_filter` API. This API by default also does not decrypt data. To change this behavior, please implement your visibility filter as presented in our documentation.
4. Karafka Web UI `0.7.0` introduces an in-memory topics cache for some views. This means that rapid topics changes (repartitions/new topics) may be visible up to 5 minutes after those changes.
3. `ui.decrypt` setting has been replaced with `ui.visibility_filter` API. This API by default also does not decrypt data. To change this behavior, please implement your visibility filter as presented in our documentation.
4. Karafka Web-UI `0.7.0` introduces an in-memory topics cache for some views. This means that rapid topics changes (repartitions/new topics) may be visible up to 5 minutes after those changes.
5. Karafka Web UI requires now a new topic called `karafka_consumers_metrics`. If you use strict topic creation and ACL policies, please make sure it exists and that Karafka can both read and write to it.

## 0.6.3 (2023-07-22)
- [Fix] Remove files from 0.7.0 accidentally added to the release.

## 0.6.2 (2023-07-22)
- [Fix] Fix extensive CPU usage when using HPET clock instead of TSC due to interrupt frequency.

## 0.6.1 (2023-06-25)
- [Improvement] Include the karafka-web version in the status page tags.
- [Improvement] Report `karafka-web` version that is running in particular processes.
- [Improvement] Display `karafka-web` version in the per-process view.
- [Improvement] Report in the web-ui a scenario, where getting cluster info takes more than 500ms as a warning to make people realize, that operating with Kafka with extensive latencies is not recommended.
- [Improvement] Continue the status assessment flow on warnings.
- [Fix] Do not recommend running a server as a way to bootstrap the initial state.
- [Fix] Ensure in the report contract, that `karafka-core`, `karafka-web`, `rdkafka` and `librdkafka` are validated.

- [Improvement] Display the error origin as a badge to align with consumers view topic assignments.
- [Improvement] Collect more job metrics for future usage.

- [Refactor] Cleanup common components for errors extraction.
- [Refactor] Remove not used and redundant partials.
- [Maintenance] Require `karafka` `2.1.4` due to fixes in metrics usage for workless flows.

### Upgrade Notes

Because of the reporting schema update, it is recommended to:

- First, deploy **all** the Karafka consumer processes (`karafka server`)
- Deploy the Web update to your web server.

Please note that if you decide to use the updated Web UI with not updated consumers, you may hit a 500 error or offset related data may not be displayed correctly.

#### Disabling producers instrumentation

Producers error tracking **is** enabled by default. If you want to opt out of it, you need to disable the producers' instrumentation by clearing the producers' listeners:

```ruby
Karafka::Web.setup do |config|
  # Do not instrument producers with web-ui listeners
  config.tracking.producers.listeners = []
end
```

#### Custom producers instrumentation

By default, Karafka Web-UI instruments only `Karafka.producer`. If you use producers initialized by yourself, you need to connect the listeners to them manually. To do so, run the following code:

```ruby
::Karafka::Web.config.tracking.producers.listeners.each do |listener|
  MY_CUSTOM_PRODUCER.monitor.subscribe(listener)
end
```

Please make sure **not** to do it for the default `Karafka.producer` because it is instrumented out of the box.
