# Karafka Web changelog

## 0.7.7 (Unreleased)
- [Fix] Remove `thor` as a CLI engine due to breaking changes.

## 0.7.6 (2023-10-10)
- [Fix] Fix nested SASL/SAML data visible in the routing details (#173)

## 0.7.5 (2023-09-29)
- [Enhancement] Update order of topics creation for the setup of Web to support zero-downtime setup of Web in running Karafka projects.
- [Enhancement] Add space delimiter to counters numbers to make them look better.

### Upgrade Notes

This is a **major** release that brings many things to the table.

#### Configuration

Karafka Web UI now relies on Roda session management. Please configure the `ui.sessions.secret` key with a secret value string of at least 64 characters:

```ruby
# Configure it BEFORE enabling
Karafka::Web.setup do |config|
  # REPLACE THIS with your own value. You can use `SecureRandom.hex(64)` to generate it
  # You may want to set it per ENV
  config.ui.sessions.secret = 'REPLACE ME! b94b2215cc66371f2c34b7d0c0df1a010f83ca45 REPLACE ME!'
end

Karafka::Web.enable!
```

#### Deployment

Because of the reporting schema update and new web-ui topics introduction, it is recommended to:

0. Make sure you have upgraded to `0.6.3` before and that it was deployed. To all the environments you want to migrate to `0.7.0`.
1. Upgrade the codebase based on the below details.
2. **Stop** the consumer materializing Web-UI. Unless you are running a Web-UI dedicated consumer as recommended [here](https://karafka.io/docs/Web-UI-Development-vs-Production/), you will have to stop all the consumers. This is **crucial** because of schema changes. `karafka-web` `0.7.0` introduces the detection of schema changes, so this step should not be needed in the future.
3. Run a migration command: `bundle exec karafka-web migrate` that will create missing states and missing topics. You **need** to run it for each of the environments where you use Karafka Web UI.
4. Deploy **all** the Karafka consumer processes (`karafka server`).
5. Deploy the Web update to your web server and check that everything is OK by visiting the status page.

Please note that if you decide to use the updated Web UI with not updated consumers, you may hit a 500 error, or offset-related data may not be displayed correctly.

#### Code and API changes

1. `bundle exec karafka-web install` is now a single-purpose command that should run **only** when installing the Web-UI for the first time.
2. For creating needed topics and states per environment and during upgrades, please use the newly introduced non-destructive `bundle exec karafka-web migrate`. It will assess changes required and will apply only those.
3. Is no longer`ui.decrypt` has been replaced with `ui.visibility_filter` API. This API by default also does not decrypt data. To change this behavior, please implement your visibility filter as presented in our documentation.
4. Karafka Web UI `0.7.0` introduces an in-memory topics cache for some views. This means that rapid topics changes (repartitions/new topics) may be visible up to 5 minutes after those changes.
3. `ui.decrypt` setting has been replaced with `ui.visibility_filter` API. This API by default also does not decrypt data. To change this behavior, please implement your visibility filter as presented in our documentation.
4. Karafka Web-UI `0.7.0` introduces an in-memory topics cache for some views. This means that rapid topics changes (repartitions/new topics) may be visible up to 5 minutes after those changes.
5. Karafka Web UI requires now a new topic called `karafka_consumers_metrics`. If you use strict topic creation and ACL policies, please make sure it exists and that Karafka can both read and write to it.

### Upgrade Notes

Because of the reporting schema update, it is recommended to:

- First, deploy **all** the Karafka consumer processes (`karafka server`)
- Deploy the Web update to your web server.

Please note that if you decide to use the updated Web UI with not updated consumers, you may hit a 500 error or offset related data may not be displayed correctly.

#### Disabling producers instrumentation

Producers error tracking **is** enabled by default. If you want to opt out of it, you need to disable the producers' instrumentation by clearing the producers' listeners:

```ruby
Karafka::Web.setup do |config|
  # Do not instrument producers with web-ui listeners
  config.tracking.producers.listeners = []
end
```

#### Custom producers instrumentation

By default, Karafka Web-UI instruments only `Karafka.producer`. If you use producers initialized by yourself, you need to connect the listeners to them manually. To do so, run the following code:

```ruby
::Karafka::Web.config.tracking.producers.listeners.each do |listener|
  MY_CUSTOM_PRODUCER.monitor.subscribe(listener)
end
```

Please make sure **not** to do it for the default `Karafka.producer` because it is instrumented out of the box.
