        # Manager responsible for receiving commands and taking appropriate actions
        # It uses the assign API instead of subscribe and it does NOT publish or change anything
        # Since its subscription is not user-related and does not run any work in the workers, it
        # is not visible in the statistics.
        #
        # There are few critical things here worth keeping in mind:
        #   - We do **not** use dynamic routing here and we do not inject active consumption
        #   - We use a direct assign API to get an "invisible" (from the end user) perspective
        #     connection to the commands topic for management. This is done that way so the end
        #     user does not see this connection within the UI as it should not be a manageable one
        #     anyhow. Also, on top of that, because we handle it under the hood, this is also not
        #     prone to saturation and other issues that can arise when working under stress. Thanks
        #     to that, probing can be handled almost immediately on command arrival.
        #   - Messages causing errors will be ignored and won't block.
        #   - Any errors are reported back to the Karafka monitor pipeline.
