  <p>
    You are about to adjust pause for an actively running consumer. This operation:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 mb-2">
    <li>Takes effect during the next poll operation</li>
    <li>May affect message processing</li>
    <li>Cannot be undone</li>
    <li>Will take effect only if the current process still owns the assignment</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-2">
    During long pauses, lag reporting on this topic partition may stop as librdkafka freezes the last known high watermark.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-2">
    Real-time, state-independent lag metrics can always be checked in the
    <a href="<%= root_path('health', 'cluster_lags') %>">Cluster Lags</a> tab
    of the <a href="<%= root_path('health') %>">Health</a> section.
