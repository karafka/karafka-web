<% alert_box_error 'Cannot Manage Long-Running Job Partitions Pausing' do %>
  <p class="mb-2">
    Manual pause/resume operations are not supported for topics using Long-Running Jobs.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-2">
    These topics partitions are automatically paused and resumed based on the message processing flow to ensure reliable and consistent behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    Long-Running Jobs handle partition pausing internally to maintain processing stability and prevent message duplication or loss.
