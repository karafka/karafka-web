  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 mb-2">
    <li>Affects all partitions of this topic across all running consumer processes</li>
    <li>Takes effect during the next poll operation on each process</li>
    <li>May affect message processing on multiple consumer instances</li>
    <li>Cannot be undone - you will need to resume partitions manually</li>
    <li>Will override any existing pause settings on affected partitions</li>

    During long pauses, lag reporting on this topic may stop as librdkafka freezes the last known high watermark.

    Real-time, state-independent lag metrics can always be checked in the
