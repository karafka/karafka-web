    <p>
      This topic has <code>min.insync.replicas</code> set to <strong>1</strong> with a
      replication factor of <strong><%= @replication_factor %></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Impact:</strong> When using <code>acks=all</code>, messages are acknowledged as soon as
      the leader replica receives them, <strong>before</strong> replication to followers completes.
      If the leader broker fails immediately after acknowledging a write, that data may be
      <strong>permanently</strong> lost even though the producer received a success confirmation.
    </p>

    <% if Karafka.env.production? %>
      <p>
        This configuration <strong>does not</strong> guarantee data durability and should be
        reviewed for production workloads where data loss is unacceptable.
      </p>
    <% else %>
      <p>
        While this configuration may be acceptable for development and testing, be aware that
        this setup <strong>risks</strong> data loss in production. Consider using production-like
        settings in staging environments to catch such issues before deployment.
      </p>
    <% end %>

    <p><strong>Recommended Actions:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>
        Increase <code>min.insync.replicas</code> to at least <strong>2</strong> to ensure
        messages are replicated to multiple brokers before acknowledgment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure your producers use <code>acks=all</code> to leverage the <code>min.insync.replicas</code>
        guarantee for durable writes.
      </li>
    </ul>
