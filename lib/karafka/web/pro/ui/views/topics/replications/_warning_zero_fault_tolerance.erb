    <p>
      This topic has a replication factor of <strong><%= @replication_factor %></strong> and
      <code>min.insync.replicas</code> set to <strong><%= @min_isr %></strong>.
      When these values are equal, your Kafka setup has <strong>zero</strong> fault tolerance.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Impact:</strong> Any single broker failure or maintenance operation will block
      writes to this topic until all replicas are back in sync. This can cause producer timeouts,
      message loss, and application failures.
    </p>

    <% if Karafka.env.production? %>
      <p>
        This is a <strong>critical issue</strong> that should be addressed immediately to ensure
        high availability of your Kafka cluster.
      </p>
    <% else %>
      <p>
        While this configuration may be acceptable for development and testing, be aware that
        <strong>this setup would cause outages in production</strong>. Consider using production-like
        settings in staging environments to catch such issues before deployment.
      </p>
    <% end %>

    <p><strong>Recommended Actions:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>
        <code>min.insync.replicas</code> should always be at least <strong>one</strong> less
        than the replication factor to maintain write availability during broker failures.
      </li>
      <li>
        For production workloads, consider using a replication factor of <strong>3</strong> or higher
        with <code>min.insync.replicas</code> of <strong>2</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>
