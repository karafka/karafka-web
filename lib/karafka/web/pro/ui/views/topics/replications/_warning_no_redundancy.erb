    <p>
      This topic has a replication factor of <strong>1</strong>, meaning each partition exists on
      only a single broker with <strong>no</strong> redundant copies.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Impact:</strong> If the broker hosting a partition fails, that partition becomes
      completely unavailable. Any data not yet consumed will be <strong>permanently lost</strong>
      and producers will be unable to write to affected partitions until the broker recovers.
    </p>

    <% if Karafka.env.production? %>
      <p>
        This is a <strong>critical issue</strong> for production workloads where data durability
        and availability are essential.
      </p>
    <% else %>
      <p>
        While this configuration may be acceptable for development and testing, be aware that
        this setup <strong>can cause data loss in production</strong>. Consider using production-like
        settings in staging environments to catch such issues before deployment.
      </p>
    <% end %>

    <p><strong>Recommended Actions:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>
        Increase the replication factor to at least <strong>2</strong> (preferably 3) to ensure
        partition data is replicated across multiple brokers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set <code>min.insync.replicas</code> to at least <strong>2</strong> when using
        <code>acks=all</code> to ensure writes are durably replicated before acknowledgment.
      </li>
    </ul>
