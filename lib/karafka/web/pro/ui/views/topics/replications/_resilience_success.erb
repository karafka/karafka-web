    This topic can tolerate up to <strong><%= @replication_factor - @min_isr %></strong> broker failure(s)
    while maintaining write availability. With a replication factor of <strong><%= @replication_factor %></strong>
    and <code>min.insync.replicas</code> set to <strong><%= @min_isr %></strong>, your data remains
    available even during broker maintenance or unexpected outages.
